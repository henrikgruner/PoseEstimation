## Iterative Pose Refinement in 6D

Iteratively refining the pose estimation with deep learning by inputing a concatenation of i) the original image ii) rendered image from estimated pose and iii) the depth image of the original pose. The data set used is the ModelNet40, and preparement instructions is in the data set folder.
